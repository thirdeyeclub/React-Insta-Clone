I build anew. I finished what I had left for day 01 after lunch. Understanding Mounting
was easy and it was simple to refactor the render though a mounting component. Figuiring
out how to add comments was less easy. It's midnight now and I still need to do the 
search fuction , add the likes , and the strech probelm. I think I should be done before
i sleep, but I dont know. At least i got the icons to work. I installed font awesome
for react instead of just imputing them thought the html.. This caused way too
much confusiaon and I had another student walk me though the better way. Im hopeful ill
have a finished product by thursday night...
